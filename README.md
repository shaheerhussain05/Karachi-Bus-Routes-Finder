# üöç Karachi Bus Route Finder

A desktop-based application built with **Python**, **Tkinter (ttkbootstrap)**, **Folium**, and **PIL** that finds the shortest and most efficient bus route between two locations in Karachi. This project supports intelligent routing via **A\*** search with recovery, **BFS**, and an optional **Evolutionary Algorithm**.
